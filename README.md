Works only on Windows

## Building

### What you need

- Vulkan SDK ( used as QML backend )
- cmake v > 3.20
- QT 6.8.X
- Internet ( it does fetch content while building )

### Compile

> [!TIP]
> Do yourself a favor and use QT Creator

1. Open the cmake Project in QT creator
2. Configure with a QT 6.8 kit
3. and build... Tadaaa

#### Without Qt Creator

I have no Idea
